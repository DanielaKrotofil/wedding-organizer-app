        <p className="text-paragraph">Naturally, the size of your wedding and budget will determine who will be included in your wedding guest list but the general rule of thumb for a wedding guest list is immediate family members (parents, grandparents, siblings, uncles, aunties and cousins), close friends and partners of these guests. If space permits they can then consider more distant family members, friends they would love to include but haven't seen in a while, work colleagues and family members/friend's children. </p>

    <div className="text">
        <p className="text-paragraph">Traditionally, no matter who's paying for your event, you should split your wedding guest list into three parts: one-third are guests of the bride's parents, one-third are guests of the groom's, and the rest are guests of the couple. With that said, the rule of thirds doesn't always work and many guest lists develop naturally. That's perfectly fine, too.</p>
        <p className="text-paragraph">If his parents want to invite more than their third (without exceeding your venue's capacity, of course), and yours are uncomfortable with that, your fianc√©'s family should help with the added costs. If that's out of the question, they'll have to make some tough decisions and cut down their list. One last option? You and your groom can always invite fewer friends to make room for those additional attendees.</p>
